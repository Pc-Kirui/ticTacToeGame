## Overview

### The challenge

The project entailed building a Tic Tac Toe game that can be played in the browser. The challenge was to build it in a way that it could be played in full, in the console. This strategy ensures the game logic is seperate from the UI, which ensures the code has integrity and is not concerning itself with what is happening in the browser window.

## My Process

### Build with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Javascript

### What I learned

In this project I was given some instructions on how to approach it. Started by making sure that the project worked in the console first before working on the UI.

With the project I understood the concept of using factory functions, which is a way of creating objects without using the keyword new or class syntax. Also learned the concept of encapsulation and data privacy, since the only way to interact with the data is through the public methods returned by the functions.

Improved my skills on using relative units in CSS which is key in building responsive designs.

### Continued development

- Factory functions and modules
- Responsive designs

### Useful resources

- [Building a house from the inside out](https://www.ayweb.dev/blog/building-a-house-from-the-inside-out) is a great article that can help in understanding the concept of factory functions.
